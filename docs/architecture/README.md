# PolkaFoundry Architecture

To understand how PolkaFoundry resolves the blockchain's challenges, first, we need to take a look at its system architecture.

PolkaFoundry blockchain is an account-based (as opposed to UTXO) blockchain. Every transaction is a contract call. For example, to issue or transfer an asset, one calls the "issue' or "transfer' function, respectively, of the "Assets" system contract. To deploy a smart contract one calls the "deploy" function of "ContractDeployer" system contract, supplying the contractâ€™s bytes. This way, the blockchain core can handle all transactions the same way, avoiding the maintenance overhead of the approach of using transaction types.

Under the hood, a full node includes the following primary components.

1. **Tendermint Core** for peer-to-peer, consensus, and transaction raw data management. Tendermint also includes an RPC interface for clients to submit transactions and query states.

2. A **Transaction Analyzer** to analyze transactions, put them into groups, and dispatch them to the Transaction Executor Pool.

3. A **Transaction Executor Pool** is a process pool to isolate contract execution environments from the main process for safety reasons. Transactions can run in parallel by different processes if the Transaction Analyzer determines so.

4. A **Contract Execution Engine** that executes the smart contract. It is a wrapper around Google V8 Engine, supporting both JavaScript and WebAssembly.

5. A **State Manager** to manage global state. It persists state to a LevelDB and maintains a state cache similar to Redis. The state can be accessed from other processes like ones from the Transansaction Execution Pool.

6. A bunch of **System Contracts** to enable PolkaFoundry Blockchain features like Asset Management, Alias (Naming) Management, Digital Identity, Permissions, Decentralized Gate, etc. The Decentralized Gate is where a contract can communicate with the external, off-mainchain world.

The PolkaFoundry specifies how the blockchain shall communicate with off-chain data sources, trusted execution environments, and other blockchains. It also defines a protocol for working with a type of integrated sidechain called "Autonomous Area".
