# About PolkaFoundry

::: warning NOTICE

PolkaFoundry roadmap consists of 2 phases. In phase 1, the platform is developed using Tendermint engine. In phase 2, it is rebuilt using Substrate framework, levaraging the Polkadot ecosystem while utilizing the knowhow and innovative features of phase 1.

We are in the process to migrate this documentation from phase 1 to phase 2. As a result, some parts are not up-to-date yet.

## Background

Blockchain is a useful and revolutionary technology which is getting a lot of attention in recent years. However, despite much anticipation, no significant blockchain adoption has been observed. 

PolkaFoundry is designed to enable the first useful, accessible, and widely-adopted decentralized application (dApp). In the long run, it aims to be a viable decentralized alternative to cloud computing platforms. 
 
The blockchain industry is yearning for the first "killer app" to validate this technology. Although plenty of blockchains exist with billions of USD invested, such an application remains elusive. If PolkaFoundry can do that, it is a game-changer. 

## What is PolkaFoundry?

PolkaFoundry is a one-stop dApp factory providing interoperability with DeFi and Web 3.0 ecosystems by leveraging the Polkadot multi-chain blockchain.

It’s optimized to tackle various real-world problems, especially those related to dapp UX, to the highest standard of practice and efficiency demanded from the non-stop technological industry nowadays.

The platform consists of a public blockchain (the PolkaFoundry blockchain) plus several dapp developer support services, including identity service (PolkaID), document storage service (DocuGuard), and Oracle service (Decentralized Gate).

## Vision & Mission

PolkaFoundry’s mission is to become the Polkadot ecosystem’s number-one one-stop DeFi production hub with all the tools, services, and features available for DeFi experiments, innovations, and real-world solutions.

Our vision is to empower every person on earth with complete control and the freedom to utilize their valuable assets in a way that is digitalized, secure, and accessible. Developers then could choose either centralized or decentralized technology, or a combination of both, depending solely on the value of application data and trustworthiness of relevant parties instead of the maturity and usability of the underlying technology.

## PolkaFoundry's Key Point

1. Leveraging the thrilling ecosystem, true interoperability, and the unprecedented scalability of Polkadot and Substrate;
2. Unique UX-enabling features bring dapps to a much broader population;
3. EVM-compatible, straightforward to migrate from Ethereum;
4. Built-in Made-for-DeFi services make it easy for DeFi apps to manage identities, store files, and access Oracle data.

## What does PolkaFoundry help?

#### The blockchain landscape and roadblocks

The blockchain’s chaotic gold rush will be over soon. When the dust settles, only the ones who solve real-world problems and bring value to people will survive and prosper. However, blockchain applications nowadays still put heavy burdens on users. Indeed, while the benefits blockchain promises are abstract and ambiguous, the friction it introduces is very concrete and immediate.

#### PolkaFoundry’s distinctive and practical approach

PolkaFoundry puts an end to the friction in dapps' UX to make decentralized applications (dApps) more approachable for end-users, to the point that they will not notice those are built on blockchain. At the moment, none of the current blockchains can do that. Our mission is to realize the world’s first killer blockchain app - one that is used by millions.

# What can be built on PolkaFoundry?

## Open Lending Platforms
PolkaFoundry can connect dapps to reliable sources for price feeds and credit checks to automate loan decisions.

## Decentralized Insurance
Dapps can integrate PolkaID for identity verification and query for real-world incidents for automatic insurance payment.

## Cross-chain DEX
DEX can exchange tokens on parachains or crypto-currencies on external chains (BTC, ETH, etc.) via bridges.

## DeFi Derivatives
With PolkaFoundry’s EVM support, it is strait-forward to bring ideas from Ethereum derivatives dapps to the Polkadot ecosystem. The smart and intuitive features of PolkaFoundry can drive new innovations into this space.

## Prediction Markets
PolkaFoundry provides prediction dapps with real-time event data and reliable randomness sources to determine prediction results.

## Auction & Marketplaces
PolkaFoundry enables dapps to create frictionless UX to attract larger audiences such as artists, musicians, and collectors. Marketplaces can also store assets’ metadata and large files on PolkaFoundary’s DocuGuard service.
