> PolkaFoundry roadmap consists of 2 phases. In phase 1, the platform is developed using Tendermint engine. In phase 2, it is rebuilt using Substrate framework, levaraging the Polkadot ecosystem while utilizing the knowhow and innovative features of phase 1.

> We are in the process to migrate this documentation from phase 1 to phase 2. As a result, some parts are not up-to-date yet.

## Background

Blockchain is a useful and revolutionary technology which is getting a lot of attention in recent years. However, despite much anticipation, no significant blockchain adoption has been observed. 

PolkaFoundry is designed to enable the first useful, accessible, and widely-adopted decentralized application (dApp). In the long run, it aims to be a viable decentralized alternative to cloud computing platforms. 
 
The blockchain industry is yearning for the first "killer app" to validate this technology. Although plenty of blockchains exist with billions of USD invested, such an application remains elusive. If PolkaFoundry can do that, it is a game-changer. 

## What is PolkaFoundry?

PolkaFoundry is a one-stop dApp factory providing interoperability with DeFi and Web 3.0 ecosystems by leveraging the Polkadot multi-chain blockchain.

It’s optimized to tackle various real-world problems, especially those related to dapp UX, to the highest standard of practice and efficiency demanded from the non-stop technological industry nowadays.

The platform consists of a public blockchain (the PolkaFoundry blockchain) plus several dapp developer support services, including identity service (PolkaID), document storage service (DocuGuard), and Oracle service (Decentralized Gate).

## Vision & Mission

PolkaFoundry’s mission is to become the Polkadot ecosystem’s number-one one-stop DeFi production hub with all the tools, services, and features available for DeFi experiments, innovations, and real-world solutions.

Our vision is to empower every person on earth with complete control and the freedom to utilize their valuable assets in a way that is digitalized, secure, and accessible. Developers then could choose either centralized or decentralized technology, or a combination of both, depending solely on the value of application data and trustworthiness of relevant parties instead of the maturity and usability of the underlying technology.

## PolkaFoundry's Key Points

1. Leveraging the thrilling ecosystem, true interoperability, and the unprecedented scalability of Polkadot and Substrate;
2. Unique UX-enabling features bring dapps to a much broader population;
3. EVM-compatible, straightforward to migrate from Ethereum;
4. Built-in Made-for-DeFi services make it easy for DeFi apps to manage identities, store files, and access Oracle data.
